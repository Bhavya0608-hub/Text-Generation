# Text-Generation
# 📜 LSTM-Based Text Generation

This project uses an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural network to generate text based on a given seed input. It learns patterns from custom training data and generates new text one word at a time.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Type**: Custom dataset (e.g., course descriptions, articles, etc.)
- **Format**: Plain text
- **Purpose**: Teach the model to generate coherent text sequences

---

## 🧠 What this project does

- Loads and tokenizes training text  
- Preprocesses sequences and pads them to uniform length  
- Builds and trains an LSTM-based model  
- Generates new text from a seed phrase  
- Adds one word at a time based on predictions

---

## 🔧 Libraries Used

- `tensorflow / keras`
- `numpy`
- `pickle`  
- `time`  

⚙️ Project Workflow--->

1. Data Preparation-
     Load and clean raw text
     Tokenize using Keras Tokenizer
     Create n-gram sequences
     Pad sequences for LSTM input

2. Model Building-
     Create a Sequential model
     Add Embedding → LSTM → Dense layers

3. Training-
     Use categorical crossentropy as loss
     Train on sequences for multiple epochs

4. Text Generation-
     Start with a seed input
     Predict and append next word iteratively
     Display growing sentence in real-time

🧪 Sample Output-

Input: The course details  
Output: The course details follows a monthly subscription model where you have to make monthly payments of rs 799

Generated word-by-word like:

The course details
The course details follows
The course details follows a
The course details follows a monthly
...


📌 Future Improvements-

Fine-tune with larger or domain-specific datasets
Add punctuation, grammar correction
Use advanced models like GPT or BERT
Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
